###### I like my katayunos with coffee. :coffee:

So, I heard you like testing your code. Here's a bootstrap project using
[coffee](http://coffeescript.org) and [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) to your [katayuno](http://katayunos.com/) enjoyment.

## Setting up
######Â That's easy

First you need to have [nodejs](nodejs.org) installed on your computer.
For Windows or Mac binaries, you may want to take a look [here](https://nodejs.org/download/), where you can also find the source code.

If you are more in the Linux way, you should check out [this  debs](https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/ubuntu/node.js)

Ensure you have `npm` and `node` in your `PATH`.

Once you are set with nodejs, the next step would be to clone this repo and, maybe, rename it.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/aberigle/katacoffee katayuno-with-coffee
```

If you intend to create a new git repo for your own joy, you may want to [download a zip with the project](https://github.com/aberigle/katacoffee/archive/master.zip) better, and not having your git history messed up by me.

Then, you have to install the project dependencies, as follows:

```
$ cd path/of/the/project && npm install
```

When `npm` finishes doing its magic you can run your test with
```
$ npm test
```

## Then what
###### You code :muscle:

What happens next is really up to you, open your favourite [text editor](http://atom.io) and go code. You may want to start checking out that broken function in `src/foo.coffee`

## Extra
###### I like extras

I usually find [this tool](http://nodemon.io/) very useful when running my tests.
